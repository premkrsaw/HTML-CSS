This is a Parallax Website I created using just HTML and CSS. It uses the parallax scrolling effect, which makes the background move at a different speed than the content on top. This gives the site a cool 3D effect while scrolling.

Features
Parallax Effect: A fun scrolling effect that adds depth.
Responsive Design: Works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.
Simple and Clean Design: Easy to use and nice to look at.
No JavaScript Needed: Built with just HTML and CSS
