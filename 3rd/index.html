        <h2>NATURE</h2>
        <p>
        Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the
        greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to
        recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
        writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation
        inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly
        valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially,
        nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the
        air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon
        we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of
        both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age
        should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing
        nature before it gets too late.

        <h2>Significance of Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. In other words, it offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of damages and harms. Survival of mankind without nature is impossible and humans need to understand that.

            If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind. Every form of nature, for instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds equal significance for us. Absence of one element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of human life.
            
            We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking healthy, which nature gives us. Similarly, it provides us with water and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine, the two most important elements to survive are derived from nature itself.
            
            Further, the air we breathe and the wood we use for various purposes are a gift of nature only. But, with technological advancements, people are not paying attention to nature. The need to conserve and balance the natural assets is rising day by day which requires immediate attention.</p>

        <h2>WHAT NATURE GIVE US </h2>
        <p>There is no question that Earth has been a giving planet. Everything humans have needed to survive, and thrive, was provided by the natural world around us: food, water, medicine, materials for shelter, and even natural cycles such as climate and nutrients. Scientists have come to term such gifts ‘ecosystem services’, however the recognition of such services goes back thousands of years, and perhaps even farther if one accepts the caves paintings at Lascaux as evidence. Yet we have so disconnected ourselves from the natural world that it is easy—and often convenient—to forget that nature remains as giving as ever, even as it vanishes bit-by-bit. The rise of technology and industry may have distanced us superficially from nature, but it has not changed our reliance on the natural world: most of what we use and consume on a daily basis remains the product of multitudes of interactions within nature, and many of those interactions are imperiled. Beyond such physical goods, the natural world provides less tangible, but just as important, gifts in terms of beauty, art, and spirituality.</p>

        <h2>HUMAN IMPACT ON ENVIORMENT</h2>
        <P>
            Ecological problem is one of the most important issues nowadays. Human activities have a negative impact on the environment. Humanity currently faces problems with air, water, and lands pollution, unreasonable agricultural systems, deforestation, and others. As a result, the number of available natural resources is decreasing. Another negative consequence of human activities is the process of global warming and global climate changes. These changes affect the whole Earth and might result in adverse consequences for people and wild nature (“The Consequences of Climate Change”). Therefore, it is obvious that the situation should be improved.

            <h2>ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE FOR THE PLANET</h2>
            <P>April 22 is Earth Day, a time to appreciate everything the natural world provides for us—from the water that replenishes us, to the food that nourishes us, and the trees that help provide the oxygen we breathe, we celebrate the planet we call home. It’s also a day to encourage more climate-friendly choices and shed light on the pressing environmental challenges we’re facing today.

                The 2022 Living Planet Report showed us that climate change and biodiversity loss are the twin emergencies of our time, threatening the well-being of current and future generations. However, we also learned we have the capability to reverse these trends. It’s more important now than ever that we make our planet a priority. In continuation of last year’s Earth Day theme, we ask that everyone “Invest in Our Planet,” once more.
                
                More transformation action is needed, and we can’t do it alone. We need everyone - business, governments, and individuals like you - to help create lasting change. Through collective individual actions, we can invest in our planet’s future by making more sustainable lifestyle choices, urge greater climate action from both our government officials and business leaders, and support organizations that are making a difference.
                
                We know this sounds daunting, so together with WWF’s experts across key areas, we created a guide detailing 60 Actions for the Planet to help you reduce your footprint and embrace more Earth-friendly lifestyle choices. Though we’ve had many Earth Days since its inception in 1970, we only have one Earth. Join us in giving back to our planet this Earth Day and beyond.</P>
